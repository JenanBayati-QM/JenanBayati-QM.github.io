## Day 21 (28.08.2023)
I continued working on the jewlery. I added texture to it that I had to play with a bit as there are many options to choose from. Also. I sculpted every pearl uniqely. There were over 100 objects that I had to work on separately. That took mos of my time. 

As I was done with my pearl jewlery I had to choose where to put it in order to use it as AR filter. First I searched for Open Source but the I thought <b>What if it was a filter in instagram?</b> more people would stumble up on it and would like to see it live. That then was what I aimed for.

In order to make a filter I had to work on Meta Spark AR platform. I Exported my final object and imported it to Spark. Unfortunately the file was too big so I had to go back and make some changes. In order to make the objest smaller I used a mesh tool that automaticly decreases the amount of meshes and convert the mesh from quad to triangle and vice versa.

Unfortunately, my texture desapeard and as I wanted to make a fast prototype I chose to leave it that way. Gladly blender had an Spark plug in that helped optimaze the object to Spark. It worked well and was easy to use. After that I exported my smaller object to Spark without any problems.

Working in Spark was relativly easy and I got to but the jewlery as a working filter. It looked a bit stiff but it still worked.

If I could make it again I would have worked more on the texture and make it look more realistic. Also, would have spend more time on Spark to discover different options.
