## Day 21 (28.08.2023)
<b>I</b> continued working on the jewlery. I added texture to it that I had to play with a bit as there are many options to choose from. Also. I sculpted every pearl uniqely. There were over 100 objects that I had to work on separately. That took mos of my time. 

As I was done with my pearl jewlery I had to choose where to put it in order to use it as AR filter. First I searched for Open Source but the I thought <b>What if it was a filter in instagram?</b> more people would stumble up on it and would like to see it live. That then was what I aimed for.

In order to make a filter I had to work on Meta Spark AR platform. I Exported my final object and imported it to Spark. Unfortunately the file was too big so I had to go back and make some changes. In order to make the objest smaller I used a mesh tool that automaticly decreases the amount of meshes and convert the mesh from quad to triangle and vice versa.

Unfortunately, my texture desapeard and as I wanted to make a fast prototype I chose to leave it that way. Gladly blender had an Spark plug in that helped optimaze the object to Spark. It worked well and was easy to use. After that I exported my smaller object to Spark without any problems.

Working in Spark was relativly easy and I got to but the jewlery as a working filter. It looked a bit stiff but it still worked.

If I could make it again I would have worked more on the texture and make it look more realistic. Also, would have spend more time on Spark to discover different options.

## Day 22 (29.08.2023)

<b>Today</b> I started to make a summary of the book: Storytelling with Data. I had done few notes and thought It would be useful for new interns. 

I collected all my notes, added some more and made sure that they were from the book. Also, I gatecorized all the information and made a logical content list out of it.

Tomorrow I will start doing the Summary.

## Day 23 (30.08.2023)

<b>For</b> the whole day I worked on the Summary as I did everything on it myself. Also, I got an assignment to make a few slide presentation about Service Design. 

I was really excited as I get to talk about it to the LM team.

## Day 22 (29.08.2023)

<b>Today</b> I thought how can I summaries service Design in few slides. What is relevant and what is not. What examples should I show and most importly how we can use it in the museum field.

I ended up writing about most important attribute to service design. I thought how could I explain it to somebody who has not heard of it before.

As a result I did nine bullet points about what Service Design means and did an example of audio guide journeymap and SWOT analyses of it.

## Day 24 (30.08.2023)

<b>Today</b> I thought about the layout, made icons to it, used LM colors and finalized it. Also, for the examples I did grafics.

Making this took me the whole day but I am excited to present it to everybody on Sunday. Hopefully my team will get a better undrestanding of SD and might even use it in their field.

Also, I forgot to write my blog so I wrote this week's tasks on Friday.
