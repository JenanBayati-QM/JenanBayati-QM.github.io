## Day 11 (13.08.2023)
<b>It's my third week</b>

For the whole day I read the book: Storytelling with Data. I coverd about 80 pages and made a lot of notes so I can go back to them when needed. 

Things that I learned was what charts are good to use and what should I avoid e.g. Pie Graphs!

## Day 12 (14.08.2023)

Today I read and went through all the chapters in the book except the Case studies. I will let the information settle down in my head and start tomorrow doing the charts. 

Also, I thought a bit what should I make my graph about. The Data I will get from our Surveys.

## Day 13 (15.08.2023)

At 8:30 we had a meeting with my coâ€“ Intern. It was nice to talk to her as we had completly different tasks. We also shared our last week's Audio Guide platform links.

I finished the Case Study section and started to go through the surveys. As I was compering them I thought that I could transfer all the data in to excel. So, I did it and it took quite a while as I was thinking what would be the smartes way to section them.

As I was transfering the data I decided to make graph about: <b>How different ages interact with media.</b>

The excel sheet will be open for the staff who might be interested or want to use it.

## Day 14 (16.08.2023)

After finishing the excel table I started to make my graph. As it was related to ages I used the Horizontal Bar Graph. It was the smartes choice and most eye friendly.

I did it in excel and edited it to make it as minimal as possible. The data was easily transferred from sheet to sheet inside excel.

At the end of the day I still was not quite satisfied so I decided to further edit it in Illustrator.

## Day 15 (17.08.2023)

For the whole day I edited my excel graph in Illustrator where I can manipulate more of the elements freely. I also wanted to do an another graph where I would present a pie chart in a text form. This was mentioned in the book so I tried it out.

The question was: <b>Is it your first time visiting this museum?</b> It turned to be much nicer way to present the data.

I collected all the graphs in to a presentation and sent it to my supervisor with the link to the excel sheet.

For the rest of the day I was working on this blog.
