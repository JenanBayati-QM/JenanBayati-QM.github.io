I started Sunday by reading some interesting articles about museums. Here are  few of the links if interested:

At 10 AM I had a meeting with my supervisor. We went a bit through my presentation and the summary that I had made from the book: Storytelling with Data.

My supervisor also said that my Journey Map on the presentation could be more detailed. He also showed few Customer Journey maps that I could look at and make something similar. After our meeting I started working on it.

For the rest of the day I worked on two different Journey Maps:

1. Augio Guide Journey Map (Museum)
2. Audio Guide Journey Map (Website)

## Day 26 (04.09.2023)

I continued working on the maps. I was doing it in Illustrator as I am comfortable with it. I finished it by adding icons, colors, some hierarchy to text and titles along the journey to make it more understandable.

I send the final result to my supervisor and will add it tomorrow to my presentation.

## Day 27 (05.09.2023)

For the rest of the week I got as a task to make benchmarking on museums. Museum that have online collection,  shops etc.

I started to go through different museum by continents. Picked few of them and started doing benchmarkinghow they were and if there were something common etc.

The benchmarking I did on laptop as well as on phone.

## Day 28 (06.09.2023)

For today I took screenshot from yesterday’s researched museums. I took from many different parts that were interesting or if they had a nice user friendly interface.

Every screenshot that were from same museum I put into own file and inside it is phone and laptop version.

## Day 29 (07.09.2023)

Today I wanted to search more and found more interesting and innovative museums. I also took from the new ones screenshots and found pages that had Audio Guide integrated inside them. They all looked the same one as in the (ACMI).

Also, few highlights that I want to mention:

* Most of the museums had same layout --> become a member, shop, collection, new exhibitions etc.
  
* Shops had almost every time exhibition shopping, new arrivals and favorites.
  
* Collection's were categorized by theme or exhibition.

* Rijkmuseum had a impressive app.

I also included links to these museum and sent them to my supervisor.
