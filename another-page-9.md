## Day 41 (25.09.2023)

<b>I</b> read a bit aritcles again and started to go through interesting Museum Systems.

I will continue to do some research on that tomorrow.

## Day 42 (26.09.2023)

<b>I</b> have today researched some Digital Museum Systems and found a page where they offer immersive experiences to their visitors in museums. I thought it might be interesting to compare their system to QM.

## Day 43 (27.09.2023)

<b>I</b> was searching the internet for possible interesting pages regarding museums.

There was this page where they have collected all different museums, collections and artists to one platform. Their layout was very interesting and minimal. There might be some interesting features as Qatar Museums main page has all the museums and event in one page.

The link: https://www.artsy.net/

I found also this page where they have listed what museums website should include. 

These are the main topics that they have listed:
Explore Exhibition
Plan your visit
Calendar
Membership/Giving/Donations
Volunteering
More about why these topics/categories in this link: https://infomedia.com/blog/what-your-museum-website-needs/

## Day 44 (28.09.2023)

<b>Today</b> is my last day so, I worked all day on the blog.

* Everything is listed
* Layout is fine
* Pictures are working
* First letter of days are bold etc
* Dates are right

Also, I added this week's hours to the internship platform and made sure that I had listed all the days and hours right.

<b>Overall, it has been an amazing two months where I have learned a lot of new things and challanged myself. I am gratefull to have worked in QM and will look forward what future holds.</b>
