## Day 41 (25.09.2023)

## Day 42 (26.09.2023)

<b>I</b> have today researched some Digital Museum Systems and found a page where they offer immersive experiences to their visitors in museums. I thought it might be interesting to compare their system to QM.

## Day 43 (27.09.2023)

<b>I</b> was searching the internet for possible interesting pages regarding museums.

There was this page where they have collected all different museums, collections and artists to one platform. Their layout was very interesting and minimal. There might be some interesting features as Qatar Museums main page has all the museums and event in one page.

The link: https://www.artsy.net/

I found also this page where they have listed what museums website should include. 

These are the main topics that they have listed:
Explore Exhibition
Plan your visit
Calendar
Membership/Giving/Donations
Volunteering
More about why these topics/categories in this link: https://infomedia.com/blog/what-your-museum-website-needs/

## Day 44 (28.09.2023)

<b>Today</b> I worked all day on the blog as it is my last week so I made sure that:

* Everything is listed
* Layout is fine
* Pictures are working
* First letter of days are bold etc.

Also, I added this week's hours to the internship platform and made sure that I had listed all the days and hours right.
