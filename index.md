# Week 2

## Day 6 (06.08.2023)

I started today to edit my last weeks chart on "the most used media in QM". Most of the edits were based on the feedback that I got and a book called: Data as a story telling. 

Few of the changes that I made:

* For the dots and lines, I changed the chart type that made much more sense.
  
* For the title I simplified it and should be now clearer.
  
* Changed colors of the chart.
* Better layout.
