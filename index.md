# Day 1 (30.08.2023)

<b>My intership day started on Sunday, because working days in Qatar are from Sunday to Thursday.</b> 

I'm excited in a good way and I started working by doing background research on the museum itself, where I'm going to do my internship (Lusail Museum)

At 9 AM I had my first meeting with my supervisor and we talked a little about what was on this week's agenda. Since I'm doing the internship remotely, I got slightly different tasks than the intern starting at the same time as me but on site.

My tasks are mostly focused on computer, for example, analyzing surveys, presenting results, generating ideas, documenting, etc.


At 10 AM I got to the weekly QM staff meeting, where I got to know other employees and their interesting tasks.

At 11 AM My manager gave me a tour of the Qatar National Museum remotely and my internship partner on site. The main focus was on the use media devices. What different programs were running on them, how some were programmed, what were the name's of the different screens , etc.

I had visited this museum before, but it was even more fascinating to understand what is done behind the scenes, how much work has been put into it.

The rest of the day I spent on setting my new email.

<b>A very interesting first day!</b>

# Day 2 (31.08.23)

<b>On my second day I started to read and analyse data from previous observation sheet.</b>

In total I analysed 37 observation sheets first individually. After that I started to compere them with each other and tried to think what would I like to analyse deeper. From what should I  make a chart?

Unfortunately I didn't get to think deeper as I had stomach-ache an had to rest for the day.

Disclaimer, don't eat expired egg even if it looks good!

# Day 3 (01.08.23)

<b>Today</b> I continued to analyse the observation sheets and chose to do the charts about:

1. How many minute does different ages spend on an exhibition

2. How Different types move in exhibitions

In order to get the data that I want. I would go though all the sheet one by one and mark down on excel the amount of people in their section.

After all the data was in Excel I generated there a chart that would be fit for my purpose.

I exported the excel chart and finalised it in Illustrator as it gives more freedom to play with it.

The charts were ready and  I made a presentation about it in PowerPoint.  In the slides I wrote about my results, pros and cons of the observation sheet,  ideas how we could make it work better and suggested a SWOT analysis as a fast method to understand is our chart/ sheet good.

SWOT analyses stand for

*S = Strength

*W = Weakness

*O = Opportunity

*T = Threat

I will present this to my manager tomorrow and get feedback about it.

# Day 4 (02.08.2023)

I worked on how to present the presentation and did some last edits.

At 10 am I had a meeting with my manager (Weekly meeting). We had discussion about how the week has gone. I also got to ask few questions that I had in my mind. After that I presented my results of the Qualitative research.

We had an interesting discussion about it and I got few good tips when doing e.g. charts next time.
* Name axis of the chart clearly
* Be aware to choos colors that everybody can see

After the meeting I went over two Survey results of QM visitors that were analysed beforehand with the Microsoft AI. My task is to compere these two and make a chart out of it. Main focus is on the use of digital & multimedia devices

I also started doing my blog on GitHub which took more time than I thought as it was quite new for me. After many trials and errors I got it to work and will fill it in the next day.
