## Day 30 (10.09.2023)

I had a meeting with my Supervisor and we discussed about the benchmarks. It was a bit challenging to show them as I had problems with the email and could not share my screenshots. However, we decided that I would benchmark more museums and add them to file as soon as my email worked.

At the mean time I searched for more museums through Google. I tried to visit different continents museums and see if museums have globally the same layouts.

Overall I marked 17 museums web page and few of the phone version.

Gladly my email also started to work again.

## Day 31 (11.09.2023)

For today I named all my screenshots separately and put them into files so it would be easier to find them. This took a while as there were many screenshots. I also marked if they were from phone version. Shop or collection.

I dropped all the my files of museums to one drive, but it had few problems. It added an additional file and was not showing preview. I thought that maybe it was not showing it for me but would work if somebody else was seeing it.

I tried to also delete them from one drive and add again but it seemed to be the same.

Also, I did a summary of the museums.

Gladly I would have a meeting with my supervisor on Wednesday so we can check them together.

## Day 32 (12.09.2023)

Today I got a permission to go to my uni class that was madatory. Due to that I was not workig today.

## Day 33 (13.09.2023)

I had a meeting with my supervisor and we decided that I would add few more interesting museums from MuseumNext, NCM and MuseWeb speakers. Also, my supervisor did a form where I would fill all the information of the museums.

* Name
* City
* Country
* URL
* Where I found it?

Also, it turned out that even my supervisor could not see the files that I had added to One Drive. He suggested that it might be because of the file name. It started with (_:). 

After the meeting I went and deleted the files that were named wrong and added new ones with corect names. Gladly it now worked and you could see the previews.

I added also all the 17 museums to forms list. 

I did also some researching of the interesting museums. I will add them tomorrow.

## Day 34 (14.09.2023)

After researching few museums I chose 7 new ones and listed them to the forms. Additionally I screen shotted the web pages the same way as previously and added them to OneDrive.

For the rest of the day I updated and wrote about my week  to the Blog.
