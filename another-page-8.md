## Day 35 (17.09.2023)

<b>Today</b> I had time to research how can I add pictures to my blog that lead to different week's of my intern period. I also wasn't sure how the sizing works. Is it % or px etc.

I also was wondering what pictures should I use, so I searched a bit of the QM's collection. I stumbled upon a rug collection that was in Google arts&cultures. That was when it hit me that I wanted to use these different carpets as a link to next page.

Overall it took me a whole day to figure out how could I code what I wanted and what pictures to use.

## Day 36 (18.09.2023)

<b>I</b> started today to actually build the new layout of my blog. I tested what was the best size for my pictures, How much padding I wanted and where i would put my week text on the picture. 

This was quite time consuming as I had to one by one code them and add the texts. After many trials and errors it worked out and looked like what I had envisioned.

You can see the result by going back to this blogs landing page or index section.

 ## Day 40 (21.09.2023)

 <b>Today</b> I made a updated to the QM's & NMOQs landing page. The changes were based on my last weeks benchmarking on different museums websites.

 I concentrated on

 * Adding more white space
 * Less text & more visualizing information
 * Using more colors
 * Take unnecassary section away from top
 * Adding necassary sections

  I did yhese in Figma and sent the final versions to my supervisor.
