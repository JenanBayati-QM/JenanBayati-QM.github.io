## Day 16 (20.08.2023)

<b>For</b> the whole day I was editing my blog. I changed the colors to Lusail Museum colors: Black, Beige and Orange (Bit of white.) Also I got to change hover over button to orange! I also added all the photos that I wanted. It was nice because I hadn't had time to make any major changes to it.

As I was editing the blog I had few problems where my GitHub updated the elements and photos but when I went to the page itself it hadn't updated anything. I still have not solved this but I will ask help and see what the problem is.

Also, I will get my new task tomorrow :)

## Day 17 (21.08.2023)
<b>In</b> the morning I continiued a bit with my blog. It still had the same problem but would get help soon to it. 

I also got my task of the week and started going through all the links that my supervisor gave. The task: <b>Experiment with museums online collections.</b> It was very interesting to see how much is now days open source and the freedom that comes with it. You can edit and use them however you like.

For the hole day I only did research on the subject and wanted to understand how it works and what are the possabilities.
Tomorrow I will start prototyping as I alredy had few ideas what I could do.

## Day 18 (22.08.2023)

<b>I</b> started the day by going trying a bit more of the open source materials for isnpiration.

At 8.30 AM I had a meeting with my co-intern and we discussed about our last week and what we did as we were given different tasks. For this week we had the same task and were thinking what we could do.
She also suggested to try the google art & culture that could help to come up with ideas. The games in googles platform were impressive and it was fun to see what people had created with these open source materials.

After my meeting and researching I started to do my prototype. I tried to build an map from which you can see from where is the artist from and what are his paintings.

I got it to half way and will continiue working on it tomorrow.
