## Day 16 (20.08.2023)

<b>For</b> the whole day I was editing my blog. I changed the colors to Lusail Museum colors: Black, Beige and Orange (Bit of white.) Also I got to change hover over button to orange! I also added all the photos that I wanted. It was nice because I hadn't had time to make any major changes to it.

As I was editing the blog I had few problems where my GitHub updated the elements and photos but when I went to the page itself it hadn't updated anything. I still have not solved this but I will ask help and see what the problem is.

Also, I will get my new task tomorrow :)
