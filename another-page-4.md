## Day 16 (20.08.2023)

<b>For</b> the whole day I was editing my blog. I changed the colors to Lusail Museum colors: Black, Beige and Orange (Bit of white.) Also I got to change hover over button to orange! I also added all the photos that I wanted. It was nice because I hadn't had time to make any major changes to it.

As I was editing the blog I had few problems where my GitHub updated the elements and photos but when I went to the page itself it hadn't updated anything. I still have not solved this but I will ask help and see what the problem is.

Also, I will get my new task tomorrow :)

## Day 17 (21.08.2023)
<b>In</b> the morning I continiued a bit with my blog. It still had the same problem but would get help soon to it. 

I also got my task of the week and started going through all the links that my supervisor gave. The task: <b>Experiment with museums online collections.</b> It was very interesting to see how much is now days open source and the freedom that comes with it. You can edit and use them however you like.

For the hole day I only did research on the subject and wanted to understand how it works and what are the possabilities.
Tomorrow I will start prototyping as I alredy had few ideas what I could do.

## Day 18 (22.08.2023)

<b>I</b> started the day by going trying a bit more of the open source materials for isnpiration.

At 8.30 AM I had a meeting with my co-intern and we discussed about our last week and what we did as we were given different tasks. For this week we had the same task and were thinking what we could do.
She also suggested to try the google art & culture that could help to come up with ideas. The games in googles platform were impressive and it was fun to see what people had created with these open source materials.

After my meeting and researching I started to do my prototype. I tried to build an map from which you can see from where is the artist from and what are his paintings.

I got it to half way and will continiue working on it tomorrow.

## Day 19 (23.08.2023)

<b>Today</b> I continued with the prototype and I did some last edits:

* Add images
* Layout all the elemenets that they are in line
* Add LM colors
* Finished animation

I did this prototype in Figma and here is the link for anybody interested:

In between of editing I had at 10 AM a meeting with my supervior where we went through a bit of this current task. I suggested that it would be nice to try AR with some of the museums jewlery. Ofcourse, I can't yous the official jewlery but I gor permission to make one in blender and how it would work in AR as filter.

I was making rest of the day jewlery in blender.

## Day 20 (24.08.2023)

<b>I</b> continued today in blender and finished the base of my elements. I have not mentioned yet but I am working on pearl necklace. I have to add some sipmle details on the pearls and materials to the them and steel parts.

I also researched how I would tarnsfer the 3D object to AR phone filter. I found few and will continue working on it on Sunday.

As much I would have liked to work on the AR I had to come fix my blog in GitHub. Previously I could see the changes in GitHub but not on the page. I had discussed about this with my supervisor and he mentioned that my config seemed to miss something.

I fixed the config to how it was originally, also I figured out that I had changed my index page to main which was why my page would not update. After changing names it worked again!

For the pictures I was missing from the beginning a / which why it was not dispalying them.

I worked on this rest of the day but I am very happy as it is working again :))

See you next week which is <b>WEEK 5</b>
