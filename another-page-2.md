<b>I</b> started today to edit my last week's chart on "the most used media in QM". Most of the edits were based on the feedback that I got, and a book called: Data as a story telling.

Few of the changes that I made:

* For the dots and lines, I changed the chart type that made much more sense.
 
* For the title I simplified it and should be now clearer.
 
* Changed colors of the chart.
* Better layout.

<b>At</b> 10 I had the weekly meeting of QM staff. Everybody went through what they had done, and I also got to say how my first week went.

We also got our second weeks assignment: Code Audio Guide platform for an imaginary exhibition with LM guidelines. Because my coding skills are limited I started to think that I might do it in <b>Figma.</b>

I went through the research materials and visited the Audio guide of Australian Center of Moving Image's Audio Guide. I did quite a bit of research on that with a few new things that I want to try with it.

Also, I went a bit through the Lusail Museums guidelines and my day was over.

## Day 7 (07.08.2023)

<b>Today</b> I tried out if the coding would have been easier, but it was a bit overwhelming. Because of that I discussed with my manager about the possibility of Figma and luckily it was fine with him :)

Before starting to work with my own version of the Audio Guide I went thoroughly thru the LM guidelines. After that I started working on the platform.

This took me a whole day. As I was trying different colors, text and all the possible layouts.

## Day 8 (07.08.2023)

<b>Today</b> I had two meetings. One with my co-inter at 8.30 AM, which was nice as we discussed how our first week went and if we had any problems or questions. We will continue doing this every Tuesdays.

At 9.30 AM I had my second meeting with my manager as I wanted to show him what I have done until now. He gave me good feedback on the colors and how I can test them. Also, a bit of the different layouts of logos etc.

We went through a bit of how my next week would look like and what should I focus on.

After the meeting I continued working on the platform for the whole day. I saw how my mind was much clearer when thinking out loud with somebody.

## Day 9 (08.08.2023)

Today I finished the overall layout and was committing the whole day for animation of the platform. However, it took me quite a bit of time as I had few problems with Figma feature. However, after trials and errors it worked, and I got e.g. the photos and texts in carusel and the scrolling was working as I wanted.

This took me the whole day.

## Day 10 (09.08.2023)

<b>For</b> today I finalized the platform by:
* Adding depth to it
* Short Arabic text in one of the audios
* Checking that the animation works
* Moved some elements that they would look

I also had to fix a few bugs that came up in the end. Overall, I was happy with it. Of course, I would have liked to add more elements and features to it but for simplicity reasons I didn't want to make it heavy.

For the rest of the day, I worked on my blog and tried something new by adding links to each week that had the days in them. I didn't have time to add photos, but it will be on my to do list for the coming week.

And so is my second week done. I am happy as I have unlocked new skills <b>:)</b>
